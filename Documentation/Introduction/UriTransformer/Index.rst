URI Transformer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main part of the extension is not related to Typo3 at all. It's a
solo project for transforming URIs. Before I create a web about it,
you can download manual for it on
`http://download.bednarik.org/URITransformer.pdf
<http://download.bednarik.org/URITransformer.pdf>`_ . Since the whole
project was my diploma thesis, the manual contents some useless stuff.
The real manual starts on page 19. There you can find description of
the XML configuration file.
